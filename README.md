# NBA Predictions

A website designed to predict the outcome of NBA games using the power of Machine Learning.
We are seeking to better understand what goes into an individual game and what factors contribute
to a team winning. The website is meant to be an educational tool designed with sports analytics as
the primary focus. The website harnesses the power of machine learning to make predictions based on
the most recent game data.

# Current State of the Project (March 11, 2024)

The project is currently in the very early stages. There exists a website with links that, at present,
lead to blank pages with no information. There is also a very basic and rudimentary ML algorithm that
predicts who will based entirely on how many games were won by the home team at home.

# Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If there are ideas that you would like to throw around, or you have a working
feature that you would like to see as apart of the code create an issue related to what you would like to
see, or what you have done. See the related Contributions file (WIP) for specific details on the structure
of issues and what goes into a contribution for this project.
